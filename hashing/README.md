# Hashing passwords using flask_bcrypt
* Hashing a password is a process of transforming the password into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a sequence of numbers and letters.
* This transformation is done using a cryptographic hashing algorithm.
* The resulting hashed value, or hash, is unique to each input and is designed to be irreversible, meaning it cannot be converted back into the original password.
* Hashing passwords is an important security matter since it ensures that during a data breach your passwords are safe
